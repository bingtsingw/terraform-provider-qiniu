# Terraform Provider for Qiniu Cloud

This is an **UNOFFICIAL** terraform provider for Qiniu Cloud. The [official plugin](https://github.com/qiniu/terraform-provider-qiniu) doesn't provide much features and hasn't been updated for over a year, so I write one based on my own requirements.

Pay attention, this plugin is **immature** and not fully tested, use it on your own risk : (, it will be helpful if you want to join in and contribute.

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests, Chinese language is accepted, : )
